	This is the ember effect from Dark Souls 3, which appears on the player when they enter an "embered" state, either by consuming an Ember item or defeating a boss. They gain faint red outlines on certain parts of their clothes as well as appearing to have bits of cloth burned off. The burned sections seem to change based on where the camera is, and what material that part of the armor is made of, and doesn't appear to be affected by the lighting. I think it's a very unique effect that adds a lot of fine detail, keeping the flame aesthetic without simply setting the player on fire, or something otherwise extravagant.
	I believe this effect is done through a combination of texture alpha manipulation and edge detection shaders, one set being applied to the cloth materials and another being applied to the metal materials, with the cloth using texture alpha and the metals using reflection. Both seem to use the edge detection, though it doesn't looks like a "true" edge detection, as it only affects specific edges on the armors, not all of them. For the cloth, the combined effect is called a "texture dissolve", while the metals are a much-simpler reflection renderer. Texture dissolving is, according to Ronja's Tutorials from the class resources, accomplished using a greyscale texture in addition to the primary texture, which is used to control the alpha channel. this alpha channel has a value that determines how grey the texture has to be to be 'dissolved', and with the right values and textures, gives the appearance of having 'holes' in the mesh, or in Dark Souls 3's case, having parts of the armor burned away.
